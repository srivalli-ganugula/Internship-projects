# Internship / ML Projects

This repository contains descriptions of my internship projects completed during my ML learning journey as part of the Internpe Internship.

1. IPL Winning Team Prediction
- Role: ML Intern  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Description: Predicted IPL match winners using historical match data including teams, toss, venue, and scores. Learned data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  


2. Car Price Prediction
- Role: ML Intern  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Description: Built a regression model to estimate car prices based on features like mileage, year, fuel type, and transmission. Learned regression modeling and data handling.  


3. Diabetes Prediction
- Role: ML Intern  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Description: Implemented a classifier to predict diabetes using patient health metrics. Gained experience in   classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
